# Pet-Grooming-Management-Database-System-SQLite-SQL-Project-
Relational SQLite database project for managing a pet grooming business, including owners, dogs, grooming services and appointments. Includes normalised schema, table creation scripts, sample data inserts and a complete database file demonstrating core database design and SQL skills.

This repository contains a relational database project designed to manage the core operations of a pet grooming business, including owners, dogs, grooming services and appointment scheduling.

The project focuses on database design and implementation using SQLite, supported by structured SQL scripts for schema creation and data population.

The system models real-world relationships between pet owners, their dogs, booked grooming services and scheduled appointments, allowing data to be stored consistently and queried efficiently.

The repository includes:
- A complete SQLite database file
- SQL scripts to create all database tables
- SQL scripts to insert sample data for owners, dogs, grooming services and appointments
- A normalised relational schema representing business entities and their relationships

Example datasets for testing and development are included 

This project demonstrates practical skills in:
- Relational database design
- Table creation and constraint definition
- Use of primary and foreign keys
- Data insertion and integrity

Working with SQLite for lightweight database systems

The project is suitable as a foundation for further development, such as reporting, application integration or analytical extensions.
